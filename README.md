# Tic Tac Toe Game with React and Material-ui

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation and Setup Instructions

1)Clone the repo

```bash
   git clone git@github.com:tarvt/IE-hw03.git
```

2)Check if you have node installed by writing the following command:

```bash
node -- version
```

If you don't have node installed, you can install it here :
[download node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

3)After installing node, install npm by following command:

```bash
npm install
```

4)Runs the app using following command:

```bash
npm start
```

5)Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

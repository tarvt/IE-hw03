This is my third exercise for internet Engineering course , I used react.js with material ui to build a website for tic tac toe game.
For installing this project you need to do the following:
1)Check you have installed node by writing the following command:

```bash
node -- version
```

If you don't have node installed, you can install it here :
[download node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

2)After installing node check you have installed npm by following command:

```bash
npm -- version
```

3)This project uses yarn , you can install it with :

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

4)And I used material ui , so the following commands are also needed in the react directory:

```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install @mui/icons-material
```

5)After that you should go to myreact directory and just start the project :

```bash
Yarn start
```

6)go to http://localhost:3000
